# Containers logger service
This proggram is a containers logger service. 
The program listen to already running containers and new containers
and store their logs into storage. 

## Configuration
how to run it
to run the proggram use one of the following command:
node . 
node server.js 
npm start

## What you learned from it
From this project I have learned to 
create server with node.js/Express
working with mongoDB
working with Postman
dockers, images and containers
dockerize a node.js program
using dockerode package for docker

## Time invested
I have worked on that project for about 3 days

## Improvements I would have done if I had more time or knowledge:
better logic to determine which containers' logs to store 
caching the logs of the most used containers to reduce the use of DB
client-side with simple UI
